    My favorite vacation to date was a trip to the Sandals Ochi resort in
Jamaica with my wife.  Sandals resorts are adults only, and all inclusive.
I've never been more relaxed, just being able to be down by the beach with
my wife drinking rum & coke and reading books.  A nice add on was we chose
a room that included a butler.  So whenever we wanted cookies or a drink,
or to make dinner reservations at one of the nicer venues.  We would just
call Denard and he would take care of it!

    Sandals, hands down the best.

    They have a kids included alternative, Beaches resorts. Pretty fun too,
    but not as relaxing!
